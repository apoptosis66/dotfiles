# Hyperdesk

Hyperdesk is my personal post Arch installation script to keep all my beautiful ricing in one place. Its was initally a fork of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). However, I ended up wanting something simpler and less generic.  Also my taste is applications is much different than his.  I did like his theme switching and install script breakdown.

Feel free to fork and make it your own.
